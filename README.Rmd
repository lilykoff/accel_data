# accel_data

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `accel_data` is to provide code to download and organize open source accelerometry data.

## IU Walking Data

In `code/R`, there are files to analyze data from the IU walking study (https://physionet.org/content/accelerometry-walk-climb-drive/1.0.0/). The data were provided by Goldberger et al ^[Goldberger, A., Amaral, L., Glass, L., Hausdorff, J., Ivanov, P. C., Mark, R., ... & Stanley, H. E. (2000). PhysioBank, PhysioToolkit, and PhysioNet: Components of a new research resource for complex physiologic signals. Circulation [Online]. 101 (23), pp. e215â€“e220.].  All functions should be prefixed by `iu_*`. 

To cite this data please use the Physionet citation^[Karas, M., Urbanek, J., Crainiceanu, C., Harezlak, J., & Fadel, W. (2021). Labeled raw accelerometry data captured during walking, stair climbing and driving (version 1.0.0). PhysioNet. https://doi.org/10.13026/51h0-a262.].


## ZJU Walking Data

In `code/R`, there are files to analyze data from the ZJU Gait-Acc study. The data were provided by Zhang et al^[Yuting Zhang, Gang Pan, Kui Jia, Minlong Lu, Yueming Wang, Zhaohui Wu, "Accelerometer-based Gait Recognition by Sparse Representation of Signature Points with Clusters", IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, vol. 45, no. 9, pp. 1864-1875, September 2015.].  All functions should be prefixed by `zju_*`.

### Known issues
The file located in `session_1/subj_039/rec_5/5.txt` seems to be corrupted.  The code has a hard-coded section to remove that file from the main data.
